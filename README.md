# R# (R-Sharp)
![Tests](https://github.com/Robotino04/R-Sharp/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

A general purpose programming language inspired by C/C++. 


## Unit Tests
The tests used for R# are from [this](https://github.com/nlsandler/write_a_c_compiler) repository and rewritten to R#.
Any test named "skip_on_failure" will never be considered failed, since these tests require unimplemented features to work correctly.
