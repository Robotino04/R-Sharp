# R# (R-Sharp)
A general purpose programming language inspired by C/C++. 

## Unit Tests
The tests used for R# are from [this](https://github.com/nlsandler/write_a_c_compiler) repository and rewritten to R#.
Any test named "skip_on_failure" will never be considered failed, since these tests require unimplemented features to work correctly.
